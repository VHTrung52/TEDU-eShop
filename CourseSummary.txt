	- New: Add and remove role of user, add new data to seed
	- Bug: in EF 3.1.1 the hasdata update the data by determine which line of code is editted, not by id so there can be duplicate data when migration
		Ex, use the same id for 1 user but change the varible name from userid = x and id = userid to userid1 = x and id = userid1
		EF add the same user into database make the data duplicate, solution in EF 4.3 there is AddOrUpdate
